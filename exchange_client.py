"""
Thin wrapper around ccxt's BingX integration for USDT-margined perpetual
futures (swap markets). ccxt is BingX's own recommended/integrated client
library, so this avoids hand-rolling HMAC request signing for a bot that
will be moving real money.

Requires: pip install ccxt

Every method that touches the market takes `symbol` as a parameter (rather
than reading a single `cfg.symbol`) so the bot can watch a whole list of
symbols in one run -- see `cfg.symbols` in config.py.

IMPORTANT: BingX supports both "one-way" and "hedge" position modes, which
changes whether `positionSide` must be "BOTH" or "LONG"/"SHORT", and some
order-param details can shift as BingX/ccxt update their APIs. Before
running this live, place one small test trade manually (or via a Python
REPL) and confirm `create_order` behaves as expected for your account's
position mode -- see the README for a step-by-step check.
