"""
Risk management: position sizing (with a margin/notional cap), leverage
cap, a daily-loss circuit breaker, partial take-profit + trailing-stop
management for open trades, and a CSV trade journal that tracks entries,
partial exits, and full exits (so duration and realized P/L per trade can
be reported later).

The circuit breaker compares CURRENT account equity (fetched fresh from
BingX every cycle) against the equity recorded at the start of the UTC
day. This is deliberately simple and exchange-agnostic: it doesn't try to
parse individual closed-trade fills for the circuit breaker itself -- it
just asks "is my balance down too much vs. this morning?" every time it
runs, which also catches large *unrealized* drawdowns on an open
position, not only realized losses. State (including which trades are
still open) persists to a small JSON file so it survives across separate
scheduled-task invocations, which each run as a fresh process.

Partial take-profit + trailing stop (see config.py's PARTIAL_TP_* /
TRAIL_R_MULTIPLE): once a trade reaches partial_tp_r_multiple times its
original risk (1R), PARTIAL_EXIT closes partial_tp_fraction of the
position and the remainder's stop moves to breakeven; from there the
remainder is a trailing-stop runner with no fixed take-profit cap, so a
strong trend can pay out beyond the fixed 2R the trade would otherwise be
capped at. This is simulated candle-by-candle for DRY_RUN trades (see
reconcile_dry_run_exits) and, for LIVE trades, actually places the
partial-close and replacement-stop orders on the exchange (see
reconcile_live_exits and exchange_client.py) -- like the rest of this
bot's BingX order wiring, the live path has not been verified against a
real BingX account; validate it with a small real trade before trusting
it (see the README).
